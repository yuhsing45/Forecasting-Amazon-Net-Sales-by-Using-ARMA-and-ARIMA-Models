# Forecasting-Amazon-Net-Sales-by-Using-ARMA-and-ARIMA-Models
Our team uses the time series model to fit and forecast the Amazon Net sales. We divide our report into 4 sections. In Section 2, we plot the Amazon Net sales to see how this time series looks like. And we do the Dickey-Fuller test to check its stationarity. After that, if the data is non stationary, we will detrend and deseason our data to get the residual dataset for model use. Secondly, we do the stationary test on residual dataset, and plot the ACF and PACF to take a guess on our model parameters. In this project, we decided to use ARMA and ARIMA models, which in Section 3 and 4 respectively, to forecast the data. Section 5 discusses the future improvement and we will make a brief summary of our findings at the end.
